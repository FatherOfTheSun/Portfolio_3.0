            A FULL-STACK DEVELOPER</p>

        <p>It is a period of high demand its survival out here!</p>

        <p>My name is Rj Borchers, I am a very passionate Full-Stack Developer,
            I enjoy both the creative front and logic back end development.

        </p>

        <p>I enjoy spending my spare time learning new things and being in nature when I can.
            I am a huge Star Wars as you can tell.
        </p>

        <p>I have spent the last 3 years managing restaurants, I am experienced in Customer Service,
            leading a team and taking instructions for daily tasks.
        </p>
        <p> I am a ambitious teachable person, who thrives for learning and solving problems.
        </p>
        <p> I am also reserved and not one to brag but through my full-stack development courses,
            I was fortunate enough to be apart of teams that won 2nd and 1st Place in our group app projects. </p>

        <p> My journey continues.....</p>
